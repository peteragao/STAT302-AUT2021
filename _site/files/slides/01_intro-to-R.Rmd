# Vectors
---

* A **vector** is a set of values of the same type
* We create vectors using the function `c()`

```{r}
c(16, 3, 0, 7, -2)
```

* We can shorthand vectors counting up (or down) using `:`

```{r}
1:5
```


---

* We can also generate vectors using functions such as `rep()` and `seq()`

```{r}
# Sequence from 1 to 20, incrementing by 5
seq(1, 20, by = 5)
# Repeat each element of a vector 3 times each
rep(c(1, 2), each = 3)
# Repeat an entire vector 3 times
rep(c(1, 2), 3)
```

---

* We index vectors using `[index]` after the vector name

```{r}
x <- 1:5
x[3]
```

* If we use a negative index, we return the vector with that element removed

```{r}
x[-4]
```

---

## Vector Arithmetic

**Vectorization**, or applying functions across vectors/arrays, is one of R's most powerful capabilities 

```{r}
y <- -5:-1
y
x + y
x * y
```

---

Be careful! R **recycles**, repeating elements of shorter vectors to match longer vectors.
This is incredibly useful when done on purpose, 
but can also easily lead to hard-to-catch bugs in your code!

```{r}
2 * x
c(1, -1) * x
c(1, -1) + x
```

---

We can apply many functions component-wise to vectors, including comparison operators.

```{r}
x >= 3
y < -2
(x >= 3) & (y < -2)
x == c(1, 3, 2, 4, 5)
```

---

## Boolean Vectors

In code, entries that are `TRUE` or `FALSE` are called **booleans**. 
These are incredibly important, because they can be used to give your computer conditions.
What will the following code do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x[x > 3] <- 3
x
```


--
```{r, echo = FALSE}
x[x > 3] <- 3
x
```


---

## Boolean Vectors

We can also do basic arithmetic with booleans. `TRUE` is encoded as `1` and `FALSE` is encoded as `0`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# First reset x
x <- 1:5
sum(x >= 3)
```


--
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First reset x
x <- 1:5
sum(x >= 3)
```


--
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mean(x >= 3)
```


--
```{r, echo = FALSE}
mean(x >= 3)
```

--
What is this last quantity telling us?

--

By taking the mean, we are looking at the **proportion** of our vector that is `TRUE`!


---

We can also get more complicated with our indexing.

```{r}
# Return the second and third elements of 
y[c(2, 3)]
# Return the values of x greater than 3
x[x >= 3]
# Values of x that match the index of the values of y that are less than -2
x[y < -2]
# which() returns the index of entries that are TRUE
which(y < -2)
```

---

We can compare entire vectors using `identical()`

```{r}
identical(x, -rev(y))
```

What do you think the function `rev()` is doing in the code above?

*Hint:* Use `?rev` to read the help files for the function

---

## Vector Data Types

Note that vectors can only have one type of data. So we can do

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3)
c("a", "b", "c")
```
but when we try

```{r}
c(1, "b", 3)
```
R will force the entries vector to be of the same type! This is a common source of bugs.


---

## Names

We can assign names to the entries of our vectors using `names()`. This can be useful to label our data.
Note that arithmetic doesn't change the names of our elements. 

```{r}
my_vec <- c(1, 2, 3)
names(my_vec) <- c("a", "b", "c")
my_vec
my_vec + 1
```

We can then access the names as their own vector by calling `names()` again.

```{r}
names(my_vec)
```


---

## Useful functions for vectors

* `max()`, `min()`, `mean()`, `median()`, `sum()`, `sd()`, `var()` 
* `length()` returns the number of elements in the vector
* `head()` and `tail()` return the beginning and end vectors
* `sort()` will sort
* `summary()` returns a 5-number summary
* `any()` and `all()` to check conditions on Boolean vectors
* `hist()` will return a crude histogram (we'll learn how to make this nicer later)

You will need some of these for Lab 1! 

If you are unclear about what any of them do, use `?` before the function name to read the documentation. You should get in the habit of checking function documentation a lot!

# Matrices
---

* **Matrices** are two-dimensional extension of vectors, 
they have **rows** and **columns**
* We can create a matrix using the function `matrix()`

```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(c(x, y), nrow = 2, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
my_matrix
# Note: byrow = FALSE is the default
my_matrix2 <- matrix(c(x, y), nrow = 2, ncol = 5)
my_matrix2
```

.center[*Warning:* be careful not to call your matrix `matrix`! Why not?]

---

We can also generate matrices by column binding (`cbind()`) and row binding (`rbind()`) vectors

```{r}
cbind(x, y)
rbind(x, y)
```

---

## Indexing and Subsetting Matrices

Indexing a matrix is similar to indexing a vector, except we must index both the row and column, in that order.

```{r}
my_matrix
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_matrix[2, 3]
```

--
```{r, echo = FALSE}
my_matrix[2, 3]
```

--
```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_matrix[2, c(1, 3, 5)]
```

--
```{r, echo = FALSE}
my_matrix[2, c(1, 3, 5)]
```

---

Also similarly to vectors, we can subset using a negative index.

```{r}
my_matrix
my_matrix[-2, -4]
# Note: Leaving an index blank includes all indices
my_matrix[, -c(1, 3, 4, 5)]
```

---

```{r}
my_matrix[, -c(1, 3, 4, 5)]
is.matrix(my_matrix[, -c(1, 3, 4, 5)])
```

What happened here? When subsetting a matrix reduces one dimension to length 1,
R automatically coerces it into a vector. We can prevent this by including `drop = FALSE`.

```{r}
my_matrix[, -c(1, 3, 4, 5), drop = FALSE]
is.matrix(my_matrix[, -c(1, 3, 4, 5), drop = FALSE])
```

---

## Filling in a Matrix

We can fill in a matrix using indices. This is commonly done in statistical computing.
In R, you should always start by initializing an empty matrix of the right size.

```{r}
my_results <- matrix(NA, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
my_results
```


---


Then I can replace a single row (or column) using indices as follows.

```{r}
my_results[2, ] <- c(2, 4, 3)
my_results
```

We can also fill in multiple rows (or columns) at once. (Likewise, we can also do subsets of  rows/columns, or unique entries). Note that **recycling** applies here.

```{r}
my_results[c(1, 3), ] <- 7
my_results
```

---

## Matrix Entry Types

Matrices, like vectors, can only have entries of one type. 

```{r}
rbind(c(1, 2, 3), c("a", "b", "c"))
```


---

## Functions on Matrices

Let's create 3 matrices for the purposes of demonstrating matrix functions.

```{r}
mat1 <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
mat1
mat2 <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
mat2
```


---


```{r}
mat3 <- matrix(5:10, nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
mat3
```

---

### Matrix Sums `+`

```{r}
mat1 + mat3
```

### Element-wise Matrix Multiplication `*`

```{r}
mat1 * mat3
```

---

### Matrix Multiplication `%*%`

```{r}
mat_square <- mat1 %*% mat2
mat_square
```


### Column Bind Matrices `cbind()`

```{r}
cbind(mat1, mat3)
```


---


### Transpose `t()`

```{r}
t(mat1)
```


### Column Sums `colSums()`

```{r}
colSums(mat1)
```

### Row Sums `rowSums()`

```{r}
rowSums(mat1)
```


---


### Column Means `colMeans()`

```{r}
colMeans(mat1)
```

### Row Means `rowMeans()`

```{r}
rowMeans(mat1)
```

### Dimensions `dim()`

```{r}
dim(mat1)
```


---


### Determinent `det()`

```{r}
det(mat_square)
```

### Matrix Inverse `solve()`

```{r}
solve(mat_square)
```

### Matrix Diagonal `diag()`

```{r}
diag(mat_square)
```


---

## A note on `diag()`

`diag()` can also be used to generate diagonal matrices by supplying a vector

```{r}
diag(c(1, 2, 3))
```

Supplying an integer will produce an identity matrix of that dimension

```{r}
diag(3)
```

---

## Names

We can assign names to the rows and columns, using `rownames()` and `colnames()`, respectively.
Similarly to `names()` for vectors, we then access them by calling the function again.

```{r}
colnames(mat1) <- c("var1", "var2", "var3")
rownames(mat1) <- c("sample1", "sample2")
mat1
mat1 * 2
```

---

## Names

We can assign names to the rows and columns, using `rownames()` and `colnames()`, respectively.
Similarly to `names()` for vectors, we then access them by calling the function again.

```{r}
rownames(mat1)
colnames(mat1)
```


---

## Tables in R Markdown

It is easy to go from matrices to tables using R Markdown. There are several methods (check the cheatsheet link and Google for alternatives). I will present one easy method here, but what you use is up to you!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# We need to load the knitr and kableExtra package
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r}
my_tab <- data.frame(mat1)
kable_styling(kable(mat1))
```

What happened with the row and column names?

# Commenting Code
---

## What is a comment?

* Computers completely ignore comments (in R, any line preceded by `#`)
* Comments do not impact the functionality of your code at all.

--
### So why do them...

 

--
* Commenting a code allows you to write notes for readers of your code only
* Usually, that reader is you!
* Coding without comments is ill-advised, bordering on impossible

--
* Sneak peak at functions...

---

```{r}
#' Wald-type t test
#' @param mod an object of class \code{bbdml}
#' @return Matrix with wald test statistics and p-values. Univariate tests only.
waldt <- function(mod) {
  # Covariance matrix
  covMat <- try(chol2inv(chol(hessian(mod))), silent = TRUE)
  if (class(covMat) == "try-error") {
    warning("Singular Hessian! Cannot calculate p-values in this setting.")
    np <- length(mod$param)
    se <- tvalue <- pvalue <- rep(NA, np)
  } else {
    # Standard errors
    se <- sqrt(diag(covMat))
    # test statistic
    tvalue <- mod$param/se
    # P-value
    pvalue <- 2*stats::pt(-abs(tvalue), mod$df.residual)
  }
  # make table
  coef.table <- cbind(mod$param, se, tvalue, pvalue)
  dimnames(coef.table) <- list(names(mod$param),
                               c("Estimate", "Std. Error", "t value", "Pr(>|t|)"))
  return(coef.table)
}
```

---

## Comment Style Guide

* When starting out, you should comment most lines
* Frequent use of comments should allow most comments to be restricted to one line for 
readability
* A comment should go above its corresponding line, be indented equally with the next line, and use a single `#` to mark a comment
* Use a string of `-` or `=` to break your code into easily noticeable chunks
  * Example: `# Data Manipulation -----------`
  * RStudio allows you to collapse chunks marked like this to help with clutter

--
* There are exceptions to every rule! Usually, comments are to help **you**!

---

## Example of when I break my own rules

* Here's a snippet of a long mathematical function I wrote (lots code emitted with ellipses for space).
* In order to help myself read through it later, I divided the function into major steps marked by easily visible comments I can see when scanning through

```{r, eval = FALSE}
objfun <- function(theta, W, M, X, X_star, np, npstar, link, phi.link) {

  ### STEP 1 - Negative Log-likelihood

  # extract matrix of betas (np x 1), first np entries
  b      <- utils::head(theta, np)
  # extract matrix of beta stars (npstar x 1), last npstar entries
  b_star <- utils::tail(theta, npstar)

  ...

  ### STEP 2 - Gradient

  # define gam
  gam <- phi/(1 - phi)
```

---

## A final plea

* Being a successful programmer *requires* commenting your code
* Want to understand code you wrote >24 hours ago without comments?

--
.center[![David](davidsmall.gif)]
.center[.small[I just learned you can add gifs to R Markdown slides. Expect a lot of these]]

--
* If you still aren't convinced...

--
* Clear commenting is required for this course

---

## Who are you to tell me how to type?

We will be using a mix of the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) by Hadley Wickham and the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html). Please see the links for details, but I will summarize some main points here and throughout the class as we learn more functionality, such as functions and packages.

You will be graded on following good code style!

---

## Object Names

Use either underscores (`_`) or big camel case (`BigCamelCase`) to separate words within an object name.
Do not use dots `.` to separate words in R functions!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
day_one
day_1
DayOne

# Bad
dayone
```

---

## Object Names

Names should be concise, meaningful, and (generally) nouns.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
day_one

# Bad
first_day_of_the_month
djm1
```


---

## Object Names

It is *very* important that object names do not write over common functions!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Very extra super bad
c <- 7
t <- 23
T <- FALSE
mean <- "something"
```

Note: `T` and `F` are R shorthand for `TRUE` and `FALSE`, respectively. In general, spell them 
out to be as clear as possible.

---

## Spacing

Put a space after every comma, just like in English writing.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
x[, 1]

# Bad
x[,1]
x[ ,1]
x[ , 1]
```

Do not put spaces inside or outside parentheses for regular function calls.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
mean (x, na.rm = TRUE)
mean( x, na.rm = TRUE )
```


---

## Spacing with Operators

Most of the time when you are doing math, conditionals, logicals, or assignment, your operators should be surrounded by spaces. (e.g. for `==`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, etc.)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
height <- (feet * 12) + inches
mean(x, na.rm = 10)

# Bad
height<-feet*12+inches
mean(x, na.rm=10)
```

There are some exceptions we will learn more about later, such as the power symbol `^`. 
See the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for more details!

---

## Extra Spacing

Adding extra spaces ok if it improves alignment of `=` or `<-`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
list(
  total = a + b + c,
  mean  = (a + b + c) / n
)

# Also fine
list(
  total = a + b + c,
  mean = (a + b + c) / n
)
```


---

## Long Lines of Code

Strive to limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font. 

If a function call is too long to fit on a single line, use one line each for the function name, each argument, and the closing `)`. This makes the code easier to read and to change later.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
do_something_very_complicated(
  something = "that",
  requires = many,
  arguments = "some of which may be long"
)

# Bad
do_something_very_complicated("that", requires, many, arguments,
                              "some of which may be long"
                              )
```

*Tip! Try RStudio > Preferences > Code > Display > Show Margin with Margin column 
80 to give yourself a visual cue!*

---

## Assignment

We use `<-` instead of `=` for assignment. 
This is moderately controversial if you find yourself in the right (wrong?) communities.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
x <- 5

# Bad
x = 5
```


---

## Semicolons

In R, semi-colons (`;`) are used to execute pieces of R code on a single line.
In general, this is bad practice and should be avoided. 
Also, you never need to end lines of code with semi-colons!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Bad
a <- 2; b <- 3

# Also bad
a <- 2;
b <- 3;

# Good
a <- 2
b <- 3
```


---

## Quotes and Strings

Use `"`, not `'`, for quoting text. The only exception is when the text already contains double quotes and no single quotes.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Bad
'Text'
'Text with "double" and \'single\' quotes'

# Good
"Text"
'Text with "quotes"'
'<a href="http://style.tidyverse.org">A link</a>'
```


---

Phew! All done for now. Follow these rules and your code will be looking
